**Title: SecureBug File Processing Utility**

**Overview:**
The `secure_bug.py` file within this repository is a versatile utility designed for processing various types of files with a primary focus on enhancing data security. This utility provides functionalities for compression, encryption, decryption, and data integrity verification.

**Key Features:**
1. **Compression and Encryption:** This utility enables you to compress and encrypt different types of files, such as text, images, and videos. This process helps in reducing file sizes and enhancing data security.

2. **Decryption and Decompression:** You can also use this utility to decrypt and decompress files previously processed with compression and encryption. This ensures the recovery of the original data.

3. **Data Integrity Check:** Before and after encryption and decryption, the utility includes a data integrity check. It assesses the consistency and completeness of data, helping you verify that your files remain intact throughout the process.

**Usage:**
- The utility offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. It presents clear options for compression, decompression, and data integrity checks.

- Users can choose specific file types (e.g., images, videos, text) and apply compression and encryption as needed. This functionality is safeguarded with a user-provided passphrase.

- Data integrity checks are performed to ensure that files remain unaltered during the encryption and decryption process. Any data loss or inconsistencies are reported.

**Getting Started:**
To get started with this utility, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `secure_bug.py` file.
3. Use the graphical interface to select files for compression, encryption, and integrity checks.

**Requirements:**
- Python (3.x)
- Required Python packages (e.g., cryptography, tkinter, PIL)
